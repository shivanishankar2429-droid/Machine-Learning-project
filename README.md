# Machine-Learning-project
The purpose of this project was to develop a software defect prediction system based on machine learning concepts, which used a publicly available NASA dataset called the PROMISE CM1 dataset. The main goal of this system is to be able to predict which software modules would be defect prone at an early point in time in the development cycle.
